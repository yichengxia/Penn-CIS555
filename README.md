# Penn-CIS555
Here are my CIS555 (Internet and Web Systems) coursework projects in 2022 Spring.

## HW1: Web and Microservice Framework

This homework is composed with 3 Milestones.

In Milestone 0, we used an existing application server framework, which helped us to
understand how modern web frameworks operate.
We used Spark Java (not Apache Spark), which implemented a similar model to Django (Python), Node.js (JavaScript), and many
other similar platforms.

In Milestone 1, we implemented a simple HTTP server for static content (i.e., files like images, style
sheets, and HTML pages). This web server allows us to get a nice, limited-scale introduction to
building a server system as it requires careful attention to concurrency issues and well-designed
programming abstractions to support extensibility.

In Milestone 2, we expanded the webserver to handle Web service calls.
Such services were written by attaching handlers (functions called by the Web server) to various routes (URL paths and patterns).
We implemented a microservices framework that emulates the Spark API.

## HW2: Web Crawling and Stream Processing
